# Iterate

## Cyclic improvement of molecular inhibitors of alpha-synuclein

The repository contains the code used to carry out the iterative molecule improvement as applied to docking scores and then to the aggregation data using an easy-to-install version of the Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04364. The original, full repository can be found here: https://github.com/wengong-jin/icml18-jtnn

The simulation of the experimental process carried out can be be run via bin/iteration_simulation.py
